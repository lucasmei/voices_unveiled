<h2 id="what-did-we-set-out-to-do">What did we set out to do?</h2>
<p>As a group, our aim was to delve into the intricate relationship between language and identity, exploring how the use of language can profoundly impact our internal sense of self. Through many brainstorming sessions, we arrived at the idea of creating an online blog/newsletter as our chosen medium. This platform offers us the freedom and flexibility to articulate our thoughts and emotions in diverse ways, allowing each of us to express ourselves authentically.</p>
<p>Our project objective is to craft two succinct yet impactful pieces of text from each member of our group. These pieces will span a wide spectrum, delving into various facets of how language shapes both our personal experiences and the world around us. We intend to cover topics such as power dynamics inherent in language usage, the influence of language on body image and identity, as well as the complexities of gender identity â€“ all of which are pertinent themes within our course curriculum.</p>
<p>Through a blend of personal anecdotes and analytical reflections, our collective endeavor seeks to illuminate the profound ways in which language intersects with our individual and collective identities. By weaving together diverse perspectives and narratives, we aim to offer our readers a rich tapestry of insights into the multifaceted nature of linguistic influence in shaping our lived experiences.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-worked-together">How we worked together</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our primary mode of collaboration was through Discord, where we discussed ideas and shared updates. We also use Google Docs to collaborate on our work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During class, we finalized our ideas and addressed any questions or concerns. We&rsquo;ve set due dates for our written pieces and presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, we met on campus outside of class to practice our final presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of us was responsible for writing and submitting two pieces related to our assigned themes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we all contribute to the writing, Lucas managed the website and added our pieces to it. We all contributed to our portfolio document, with Salma organizing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, we all worked on our final slides, with Char polishing them. We used Google Drives for work tracking and GitHub for website development documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We worked really well as a group. Everyone felt comfortable sharing their ideas and thoughts without any worry about being judged. We were able to build on each other&rsquo;s ideas quickly and effectively, which helped us come up with our final idea in no time. By listening to and using everyone&rsquo;s input, we were able to reach our final idea very swiftly and efficiently. We all split up the work very evenly, and we stuck to our self assigned due dates as well, which made the process run very smoothly.</p>
