<p>For women, there seems to be a point in their lives where they are confronted with how their body will represent them. I remember being 8 years old the first time I really felt this. I spent the day at the park, one that had a splash pad. The type that was a really shallow, wading pool with a bunch of sprinklers and an area to run around. I was a total fish as a kid, I loved swimming and being in the water. Naturally, I spent most of the hot, summer day  in the splash pad, particularly in the wading pool area. As I swam about, a boy (who was about my age) decided for some reason to call me fat. It was the first time in my life I had ever been identified as ‘fat’ like that, at least the first I can remember. Despite the fact this was like 14 years ago, I still remember it so vividly. I even remember the daffodil colored bathing suit I wore. That evening, I cried in my mom’s arms about what that boy said. I begged her to tell me I wasn’t fat and that I wouldn’t grow up to be like that. Sure, I wasn’t a petite or small child, but was I really fat at 8 years old? The answer of course, was no. But then, why did it matter so much? After that day, I started worrying about my body. I would never wear a two-piece bathing suit again. I wanted to be thin and tiny and small. At 8…the irony is, that I was tiny and small. I was a child. But no, I had to look like my friends who were naturally thinner and weren’t developing in their bodies as fast as I was. One word would define who I thought I had to be.</p>
<p>When I was 10, I decided I was going to lose weight. After going to the fair with my
friend and seeing the number on the scale after being weighed for a trampoline jump, it was my motivator. I wrote my goal weight in my notebook and sailed ahead. I would do Wii Fit every day and run laps around the park. No longer would I be ‘fat.’</p>
<p>When I was 12-13, my mom decided it was best for me to join the gym. She got me a membership alongside her and wrote our schedule, posted on the fridge. We would do yoga classes, run on the treadmill, lift weights and do planks together. I was sweaty, tired and exhausted, but you know, it had to be done. My mom didn’t explicitly call me fat. “You need to be healthier,” “you don’t eat healthy enough,” “it’s good for your body.” There were never any other preteens at the gym. It always seemed to just be me there. I suppose I should eat healthier, but I’m not making dinner. I’m 12, should I be? Well, the Wii Fit didn’t help me lose weight, so hopefully the gym will. I just kept thinking back to that day at the splash pad. ‘Fat’ was a bad word. I didn’t want to be that. But somehow I was. I was bigger than my friends, I didn’t wear XS or S. I was developing breasts and wide hips. Even my own mom thought I needed to go to the gym. How could one word be so destructive?</p>
<p>Now I am 22. I am an adult. I never really achieved my goal of being tiny or small. I still struggle with my relationship with my body and I don’t know if that will ever go away. But I know that being fat is not wrong. It is not bad. I still mourn for my younger self. I wish I could tell her that she was worthy and beautiful. I wish I could tell her that that boy at the splash pad just thought the word ‘fat’ = bad, especially for girls. He probably didn’t know any better either.  I wish she knew that being overweight as a preteen was normal and not cause for the gym. I wish she knew what I knew now.</p>
