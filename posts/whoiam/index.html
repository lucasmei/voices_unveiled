<p>I always felt a bit different from everyone else, but couldn&rsquo;t figure out what exactly it was. Most of my friends were girls, and my guy friends were limited. I was more emotional than the rest, which could be seen as an easy way to exploit me.</p>
<p>Growing up, you are often mocked for any sort of difference that you have. Hair colour, different clothes, different shoes, different food. When growing up in the early 2000s-2010s, there was a new &ldquo;cool and hip way&rdquo; to mock people, and that was through their language. More specifically, their texting styles.</p>
<p>I find writing liberating &ndash; a medium in which I can write exactly what I want and how I want to without much worry. Especially since the invention and standardization of the keyboard, I&rsquo;ve always had an above-average typing speed making this even easier for me.</p>
<p>There are apparently different ways guys and girls type in text, and even more interestingly are the different ways queer people text. There have grown sub-categories of specific texting styles that have spawned over the years, similarly to how we have distinct speaking styles depending on the social context &ndash; only now it&rsquo;s online, and only now is it available for everyone to see as soon as you type it, and only now can you sit on what some stranger said and criticise it. It&rsquo;s like a snapshot into someone else&rsquo;s thoughts, which is essentially what a blog is. It&rsquo;s a public journal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been mocked and teased in the past by others for my texting style. I don&rsquo;t use capital letters since when typing in English, capital letters don&rsquo;t add any useful semantic meaning that punctuation already solves. I laugh using distinct keyboard mashes like &ldquo;alskjdf&rdquo; or &ldquo;sskdjksdkjsdkj&rdquo; &ndash; and if we&rsquo;re feeling daring &ldquo;SKJHFKJSD&rdquo;. I like to suffix cut-off sentences with &ldquo;-&rdquo; to express dramatic effect, like when you&rsquo;re talking and you shorten your voice with a glottal stop to show surprise (ex. &ldquo;wha- what?&rdquo;). Instead of using &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; I sometimes use &ldquo;,,,&rdquo; to emphasise pause. I don&rsquo;t use emojis much because I grew up mostly without using them. I instead use emoticons or &ldquo;kaomoji&rdquo; to express what emojis do.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s wrong with this? Why have I been criticised and harassed for expressing myself using methods different from the norm? Why am I seen as a &ldquo;lesser man&rdquo; or &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; for typing the way I have always typed? More importantly, why is it that having &ldquo;feminine traits&rdquo; is seen as threatening, or evil in the eyes of many? Why do others feel justified in seeing it as morally reprehensible?</p>
<p>These are all questions I continue to ask myself to this day, but I don&rsquo;t see such people with malice. We&rsquo;re all living life for the first time under unique situations and circumstances. What matters most is continuing being who I am. For the rest of my life, I am all I&rsquo;ll have left.</p>
