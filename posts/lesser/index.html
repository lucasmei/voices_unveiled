<p>The lesser man is trapped in the expectations of society, forced to exist only within the confines of what others place. A tall picket fence with no escape. The people didn&rsquo;t make the fence. He made the fence to protect himself from people.</p>
<p>The lesser man grows tired of being tired, but has grown tired of others. He can no longer go to others because of this fatigue, so he continues writing to himself about himself. The isolation is tiring, so he takes a nap.</p>
<p>The lesser man is seen as lesser because the lesser man is gay. At his job, he is babied by those around him. He isn&rsquo;t seen as capable. He is never taken seriously because he doesn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;straight-cadence&rdquo; to him. His colleagues treat him as an enemy, a threat to their masculinity. &ldquo;If he continues talking to all the women, there&rsquo;ll be none left for us!&rdquo;, he overhears one day.</p>
<p>The lesser man has a dream of a world where living as your true self isn&rsquo;t seen as a threat to others &ndash; where self-confidence is solved. To be oneself without fear, judgement, persecution of others, theoretically a right. In practice it&rsquo;s seen as a privilege, which upsets the lesser man. For he didn&rsquo;t choose to be the lesser man, but society sees him as such from birth. It was never a choice, rather a label pushed onto him, shoved down his throat into his stomach and pressed there until he could no longer breathe. He was suffocating.</p>
<p>The lesser man wakes up from his nap, makes an espresso, and sips it while reading Heartstopper. &ldquo;Nick and Charlie seem so happy together. I wish I could experience love like this&rdquo;, thinks the lesser man. He finishes his espresso, puts down his novel, and leaves.</p>
<p>The lesser man decides he&rsquo;ll continue to live for another day. He turns on Netflix, watches Young Royals, and drifts into sleep.</p>
