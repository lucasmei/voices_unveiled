<p>Four words. Anytime I look down to my arm, I am reminded of four words</p>
<p><em>I love myself today.</em></p>
<p>They stare back at me in deep black. The letters grow closer together with every passing day. They are a little crooked. They are not perfect. The <em>s</em> is a little thicker than the <em>y</em>. There is a freckle above the <em>l</em>.</p>
<p>These words pierced me. Scratching my veins. It hurt and it made me bleed. But a cool cloth wiped away the blood and let me read my body.</p>
<p><em>I love myself today.</em></p>
<p>The funny thing is, I didn’t love myself. I couldn’t find myself in the mirror. My mouth could not keep up with my brain. My feet could not keep up with my legs. The body I was in did not feel like mine.</p>
<p>But when I draw on my skin, it becomes my own. I am my body. How can I have this body if no one else will have the same one? It must share a home with me. These four words remind me of who I am. They are not perfect and neither am I.</p>
<p>No one else can look at their arm and see these four words like I do.</p>
<p><em>I love myself today.</em></p>
